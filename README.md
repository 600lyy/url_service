# url_service
A web application based on microservice architecture using flask

# Requirements

To build a user-facing web service that takes a URL and provides a shorter URL, when possible. When resolved, that URL should redirect the user to the original URL.

- The service should have a user-facing website (but the graphical design won't matter)
- When given a long URL, the service should shorten it and return the shortened URL
- Visiting the shortened URL should redirect the visitor to the long URL
- You should provide source code as well as a link to a running instance of your service
- You do, of course, not need to register a short domain name
- Please include your thoughts on how to deploy your service in a production environment as well as how you would scale it to millions of users
